## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Powered by YOLOv8 for fast and accurate detection
- **Office-Specific Model**: Custom trained model optimized for office environments
- **6 Object Categories**: Detects person, laptop, chair, phone,monitor,keyboard
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit web application
- **Image Upload Support**: Easy drag-and-drop image uploading
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Clear visual representation of detected objects
- **Confidence Scores**: Shows detection confidence for each identified object
- **CCTV Compatible**: Works with security camera footage and internal office images

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+** - Core programming language
- **Streamlit** - Web application framework
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** - Object detection model
- **Roboflow** - Dataset management and model training
- **OpenCV** - Image processing
- **PIL (Pillow)** - Image handling
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SXbro/smart-office-detection-tool.git
cd smart-office-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

**One-line setup after cloning:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py
```

## üéØ Supported Object Classes

The model is trained to detect the following office objects:

1. **Person** - Office personnel and visitors
2. **Laptop** - Laptops and notebooks
3. **Chair** - Office chairs and seating
4. **Phone** - Mobile phones and desk phones
5. **Monitor** - Computer monitors and displays
6. **Desk** - Office desks and workstations

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Improving the model metrics by training and adding more images to rhe dataset

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Model performance depends on image quality and lighting conditions
- Best results achieved with clear, well-lit office environments
- Processing time varies based on image resolution and system specs
- Currently supports static image analysis only
- It may not detects the objects in a high quality bc of the lack of training dataset
