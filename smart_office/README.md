## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- pip package manager

## üõ†Ô∏è Python Environment Setup (Python 3.10)

This project was built and tested with Python 3.10. Please install this version before running the code.

### Windows

**Step 1: Download Python 3.10**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.12/python-3.10.12-amd64.exe" -OutFile "python-3.10.12-amd64.exe"
```

**Step 2: Install Python**
```powershell
# Run the installer with automatic setup:
.\python-3.10.12-amd64.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Include_test=0
```

**Step 3: Verify Installation**
```powershell
# Close and reopen PowerShell, then verify:
python --version
```

**Alternative Manual Installation:**
1. Download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.12/python-3.10.12-amd64.exe
2. Run installer and check "Add Python 3.10 to PATH"
3. Verify with `python --version`

### macOS

**Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Step 2: Install pyenv**
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

**Step 3: Install Python 3.10**
```bash
pyenv install 3.10.12
```

**Step 4: Set as global version**
```bash
pyenv global 3.10.12
```

**Step 5: Update shell configuration**
```bash
# For zsh (default on macOS):
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash:
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

**Step 6: Verify Installation**
```bash
python --version
```

**Alternative Direct Installation:**
```bash
# Download and install directly:
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.12/python-3.10.12-macos11.pkg
sudo installer -pkg python-3.10.12-macos11.pkg -target /
```

### Installation & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SXbro/smart-office-detection1.git
cd smart-office-detection1/smart_office

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

**One-line setup after cloning:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py
```

## üéØ Supported Object Classes

The model is trained to detect the following office objects:

1. **Person** - Office personnel and visitors
2. **Laptop** - Laptops and notebooks
3. **Chair** - Office chairs and seating
4. **Phone** - Mobile phones and desk phones
5. **Monitor** - Computer monitors and displays
6. **Keyboard** - Keyboards that located in front of the monitor 

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Improving the model metrics by training and adding more images to the dataset

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Model performance depends on image quality and lighting conditions
- Best results achieved with clear, well-lit office environments
- Processing time varies based on image resolution and system specs
- Currently supports static image analysis only
- It may not detects the objects in a high quality bc of the lack of training dataset
