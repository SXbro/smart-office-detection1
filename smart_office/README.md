## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.7
- pip package manager

üõ†Ô∏è Python Environment Setup (Python 3.11.7)

This project was built and tested with Python 3.11.7. Please install this exact version before running the code.

Windows

# Step 1: Download the Python 3.11.7 installer
Start-Process https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.7/python-3.11.7-amd64.exe

# Step 2: Run the installer manually and during setup, make sure to:
#   ‚úÖ Check "Add Python 3.11 to PATH"
#   ‚úÖ Optionally choose "Install for all users"

# Step 3: After installation, verify the Python version
python --version


macOs 

# Step 1: Install Homebrew if you haven't already
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

# Step 2: Install pyenv (a tool to manage multiple Python versions)
brew install pyenv

# Step 3: Install Python 3.11.7 using pyenv
pyenv install 3.11.7

# Step 4: Set Python 3.11.7 as the global default version
pyenv global 3.11.7

# Step 5: Verify the Python version
python --version


### Installation & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SXbro/smart-office-detection1.git
cd smart-office-detection1/smart_office

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

**One-line setup after cloning:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py
```

## üéØ Supported Object Classes

The model is trained to detect the following office objects:

1. **Person** - Office personnel and visitors
2. **Laptop** - Laptops and notebooks
3. **Chair** - Office chairs and seating
4. **Phone** - Mobile phones and desk phones
5. **Monitor** - Computer monitors and displays
6. **Keyboard** - Keyboards that located in front of the monitor 

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Improving the model metrics by training and adding more images to the dataset

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Model performance depends on image quality and lighting conditions
- Best results achieved with clear, well-lit office environments
- Processing time varies based on image resolution and system specs
- Currently supports static image analysis only
- It may not detects the objects in a high quality bc of the lack of training dataset
